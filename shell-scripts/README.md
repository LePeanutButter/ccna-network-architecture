### Features:
- Clears the terminal screen for better visibility.

- Counting occurrences of a word in a file.
- Displaying the lines where the word appears.

### Features:

- Option to search files recursively in a directory.
- Count word occurrences without using `-o` or `awk` for efficiency.

### Example Usage:
```bash
bash /path/buscar_archivo.sh

## 3. filtrar_listar.sh
### Description:
This script lists files, directories, and symlinks in a given path and provides options to filter and sort them by different characteristics such as:

- File type (regular file, directory, symlink).

### Features:
- Recursive and non-recursive file listing.
- Sorting based on date or size.

### Example Usage:
```bash
bash /path/filtrar_listar.sh /path/to/directory

## 4. n_grupo.sh
### Description:
This script creates a new group on Unix systems (Linux or Solaris). It checks whether the group already exists and creates it with a specified GID (Group ID).

### Features:

- Compatible with both Solaris and Linux systems.
- Detects the operating system and uses the appropriate command (groupadd or groupadd -g).
- Ensures that the group does not already exist before creating it.

### Example Usage:
```bash
bash /path/n_grupo.sh groupname 1001
```

## 5. n_usuarios.sh

### Example Usage:
```bash
bash /path/n_usuarios.sh username group description /home/username /bin/bash 700 770 755
```

## Requirements:
- Bash shell.
