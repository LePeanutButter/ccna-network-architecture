This folder contains detailed logs, notes, terminal outputs, and configuration steps developed during hands-on labs for the **Network Architecture and Services (AYSR)** course at **Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería**.

All documentation here supports learning objectives from the **CCNA: Introduction to Networks** curriculum, covering areas like switching, routing, addressing, and basic network design.

> **Note:** Logs and documentation are written in **Spanish**, as they were produced as part of coursework in a Spanish-speaking academic environment.


## 1. Plataforma base Infraestructura para virtualización y redes

This project simulates a real-world IT infrastructure environment using virtualization. The goal was to gain hands-on experience installing, configuring, and managing multiple operating systems — both Unix-based and Windows — within a controlled academic setting.

Five virtual machines were created using VMware, each running a different OS: Slackware, Solaris, Windows Server (CLI and GUI), and Android-x86. Over the course of a week, students performed key administrative tasks such as:

- IP address configuration (static and DHCP)
- User and group management
- Network connectivity testing
- Exploring file systems and logs
- A short video presentation was also created to explain essential concepts like hypervisors, containers, and cloud computing.

All progress was documented through terminal outputs, system logs, screenshots, and written reports. The project aimed to reflect enterprise-level infrastructure tasks in a simplified, educational environment.
